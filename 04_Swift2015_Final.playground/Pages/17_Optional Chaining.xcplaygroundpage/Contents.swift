//: Optional Chaining as an Alternative to Forced Unwrapping
//: Optional chaining is a process for querying and calling properties, methods, and subscripts on an optional that might currently be nil. If the optional contains a value, the property, method, or subscript call succeeds; if the optional is nil, the property, method, or subscript call returns nil. Multiple queries can be chained together, and the entire chain fails gracefully if any link in the chain is nil.
class Person {
    var residence: Residence?
}

class Residence {
    var numberOfRooms = 1
}

let john = Person()
john.residence = Residence()
john.residence?.numberOfRooms

//let roomCount = john.residence!.numberOfRooms
// this triggers a runtime error

if let roomCount = john.residence?.numberOfRooms {
    print("John's residence has \(roomCount) room(s).")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the number of rooms.")
}


// prints "Unable to retrieve the number of rooms."

if let roomCount = john.residence?.numberOfRooms {
    print("John's residence has \(roomCount) room(s).")

    print("Unable to retrieve the number of rooms.")
