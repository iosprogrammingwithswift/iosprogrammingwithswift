//: ## Closures
//:

//: Functions are actually a special case of closures: blocks of code that can be called later. The code in a closure has access to things like variables and functions that were available in the scope where the closure was created, even if the closure is in a different scope when it is executed—you saw an example of this already with nested functions. You can write a closure without a name by surrounding code with braces (`{}`). Use `in` to separate the arguments and return type from the body.
//:
var numbers = [20, 19, 7, 12]
numbers.map({
    (number: Int) -> Int in
    let result = 3 * number
    return result
})

//: > **Experiment**:
//: > Rewrite the closure to return zero for all odd numbers.
//:
//: You have several options for writing closures more concisely. When a closure’s type is already known, such as the callback for a delegate, you can omit the type of its parameters, its return type, or both. Single statement closures implicitly return the value of their only statement.
//:
let mappedNumbers = numbers.map({ number in 3 * number })
print(mappedNumbers)

//: You can refer to parameters by number instead of by name—this approach is especially useful in very short closures. A closure passed as the last argument to a function can appear immediately after the parentheses. When a closure is the only argument to a function, you can omit the parentheses entirely.
//:
let sortedNumbers = numbers.sort { $0 > $1 }
print(sortedNumbers)
