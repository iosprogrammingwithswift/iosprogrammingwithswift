//: Fun Fact: Swift’s String type is bridged with Foundation’s NSString class. If you are working with the Foundation framework in Cocoa, the entire NSString API is available to call on any String value you create when type cast to NSString, as described in AnyObject. You can also use a String value with any API that requires an NSString instance.


//: String Literals
let someString = "Some string literal value"

var emptyString = ""               // empty string literal
var anotherEmptyString = String()  // initializer syntax
// these two strings are both empty, and are equivalent to each other

if emptyString.isEmpty {
    print("Nothing to see here")
}

var variableString = "Horse"
variableString += " and carriage"
// variableString is now "Horse and carriage"

let constantString = "Highlander"
//constantString += " and another Highlander"
// this reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified

//: Strings Are Value Types

for character in "Dog!🐶".characters {
    print(character)
}

//: String Interpolation
let multiplier = 3
let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"

//: Counting Characters
let unusualMenagerie = "Koala 🐨, Snail 🐌, Penguin 🐧, Dromedary 🐪"
print("unusualMenagerie has \(unusualMenagerie.characters.count) characters")
// prints "unusualMenagerie has 40 characters"


//: Character access
let greeting = "Guten Tag!"
greeting[greeting.startIndex]
// G
greeting[greeting.endIndex.predecessor()]
// !
greeting[greeting.startIndex.successor()]
// u
let index = greeting.startIndex.advancedBy(7)
greeting[index]
// a


//: Comparing Strings
let quotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
let sameQuotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
if quotation == sameQuotation {
    print("These two strings are considered equal")
}
// prints "These two strings are considered equal"

//: Prefix and Suffix Equality
let romeoAndJuliet = [
    "Act 1 Scene 1: Verona, A public place",
    "Act 1 Scene 2: Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 3: A room in Capulet's mansion",
